## 🚀 Solidity Challenge (Day 90+ and counting...)

I started this journey with a simple storage contract, and step by step, I’ve built *20+ smart contracts* that reflect real-world use cases.  
From simple storage to banks, vaults, polls, and auctions — each project taught me something new in Solidity, security, and professional development.  

### 🧱 Project Timeline
1. *[UserStorage](https://github.com/BuildsWithKing/30-days-solidity-challenge/blob/main/Day001-UserStorage/src/UserStorage.sol)* → My very first Solidity contract (Day 1)  
2. *[QuoteVault](https://github.com/BuildsWithKing/30-days-solidity-challenge/blob/main/Day002-QuoteVault/src/QuoteVault.sol)* → Learned how to store and retrieve dynamic data  
3. *[DreamVault](https://github.com/BuildsWithKing/30-days-solidity-challenge/blob/main/Day003-DreamVault/src/DreamVault.sol)* → Introduced structs + mappings for better storage  
4. *[ToDoList](https://github.com/BuildsWithKing/30-days-solidity-challenge/blob/main/Day004-ToDoList/src/ToDoList.sol)* → A simple task manager with CRUD logic  
5. *[WhitelistDapp](https://github.com/BuildsWithKing/30-days-solidity-challenge/blob/main/Day005-WhitelistDapp/src/WhitelistDapp.sol)* → Applied access control logic  
6. *[SimpleBank](https://github.com/BuildsWithKing/30-days-solidity-challenge/blob/main/Day006-SimpleBank/src/SimpleBank.sol)* → ETH deposits/withdrawals + custom errors  
7. *[DonationVault](https://github.com/BuildsWithKing/30-days-solidity-challenge/blob/main/Day007-DonationVaultDapp/src/DonationVaultDapp.sol)* → Built on top of SimpleBank to allow donations  
8. *[BasicKYC](https://github.com/BuildsWithKing/30-days-solidity-challenge/blob/main/Day008-BasicKYC/src/BasicKYC.sol)* → On-chain identity checks (basic compliance)  
9. *[VoterVault](https://github.com/BuildsWithKing/30-days-solidity-challenge/blob/main/Day009-VoterVault/src/VoterVault.sol)* → Proposal creation & voting system  
10. *[OwnershipManager](https://github.com/BuildsWithKing/30-days-solidity-challenge/blob/main/Day010-OwnershipManager/src/OwnershipManager.sol)* → Transferring and renouncing ownership  
11. *[ProjectIdeaStorage](https://github.com/BuildsWithKing/30-days-solidity-challenge/blob/main/Day011-ProjectIdeaStorage/src/ProjectIdeaStorage.sol)* → Storing ideas with mapping structures  
12. *[ContactBook](https://github.com/BuildsWithKing/30-days-solidity-challenge/blob/main/Day012-ContactBook/src/ContactBook.sol)* → Managing contact lists in Solidity  
13. *[NFTVault](https://github.com/BuildsWithKing/30-days-solidity-challenge/blob/main/Day013-NFTVault/src/NFTVault.sol)* → First NFT-related storage & tracking contract  
14. *[ReferralSystem](https://github.com/BuildsWithKing/30-days-solidity-challenge/blob/main/Day014-ReferralSystem/src/ReferralSystem.sol)* → Rewarding users for referrals  
15. *[WalletGuard](https://github.com/BuildsWithKing/30-days-solidity-challenge/blob/main/Day015-WalletGuard/src/WalletGuard.sol)* → Security-focused wallet protection  
16. *[DecentralizedPoll](https://github.com/BuildsWithKing/30-days-solidity-challenge/blob/main/Day016-DecentralizedPoll/DecentralizedPoll/src/DecentralizedPoll.sol)* → Multi-option on-chain polling  
17. *[EmailRegistry](https://github.com/BuildsWithKing/30-days-solidity-challenge/blob/main/Day017-EmailRegistry/src/EmailRegistry.sol)* → Registering and mapping emails to addresses  
18. *[StudentRecordSystem](https://github.com/BuildsWithKing/30-days-solidity-challenge/tree/main/Day018-StudentRecordSystem/src)* → Education-focused record keeping  
19. *[SimpleAuction](https://github.com/BuildsWithKing/30-days-solidity-challenge/tree/main/Day019-SimpleAuction/src)* → Auction contract with bidding logic  
20. *[GasSaverApp](https://github.com/BuildsWithKing/30-days-solidity-challenge/tree/main/Day020-GasSaverApp/src)* → First optimization-focused project  

**🔑 Progress: 20 Contracts in 20 Days (Day 80+ of Challenge)** 

**⏳ Built daily, refined with Foundry & testing.** 

🧪 *[Phase II (Day 21–30)](https://github.com/BuildsWithKing/21-30-foundry-test-deploy):* Refactor, Test, Deploy with Foundry
