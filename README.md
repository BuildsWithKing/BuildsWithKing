*“Consistency builds mastery. I’m here for both.”*

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm Michealking — a focused, driven Web3 backend developer on a journey to master *Solidity and Smart Contract Development*. Through *daily building, clean code, and structured learning*, I’m documenting every step from beginner to advanced.

### 🚀 30 Day Solidity Challenge
I'm currently building:
> *One Smart Contract Every Day*  
> From basic storage contracts to real-world vaults using structs, mappings, custom errors, and modifiers.
